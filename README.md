# lid_driven_cavity

A Python application that calculates lid driven cavity flow using Finite Volume - SIMPLE algorithm

## Motive
During the graduate class of MEEN 644, I had to do this project as a part of projectwork. Initially I developed the application in MATLAB, then converted into Python application.

## Explanation
This Python module runs the iterative calculations to solve velocity and pressure values for each Finite Volume cell. Using the SIMPLE algorithm, the pressure and velocity are coupled to solve the momentum and continuity equation in Fluid Dynamics.

## Usage
